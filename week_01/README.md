# Week 1 Notes


Hello, I am Prashant Lamichhane. I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I am currently taking Intermediate Stats and this class together using R language in both. However, my only prior experience to R is a simple visualization project done through Visual Studio Code so, I am not much experienced with R, even less with Rstudio.
